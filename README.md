# metartrivia

# TLDR
This is a work in progress.
One day it will be wikitrivia, but using the Metropolitan Museum's open art API rather than wikipedia.
Naturally, it's inspired by [tomjwatson's wikitrivia web app](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/).
For more info on the Met's API, [check out this page](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access) [or the github repository](https://github.com/metmuseum/).
Support your local art museums and artists too.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
